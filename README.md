# MultiMatest
#MultiMatest is a logic tool that test if the semantics verify a formula or group of formulas in a logic matrix (or a group of logic matrices) and also verifies when a group of matrices can verify a formula or group of formulas. Then, the input from the user can be a formula and select the values of a matrix or different values in a group of matrices or, in the other case, the user can select a formula or group of formulas (well formed formulas) and a group of matrices depending on the variables for logic truth values and the position in the matrices#

#MultiMatest will be based on MaTest, but instead of proof one by one formula and matrix, this program will be able to proof the semantic verification of a group of formulas in a matrix or a group of matrices#
